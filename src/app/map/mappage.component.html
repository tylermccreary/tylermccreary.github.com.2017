      <strong>Description:</strong>
      Going to concerts is one of my favorite things to do. I've seen many of
      my favorite bands, and some multiple times. This map displays concerts and
      shows I've been to, along with details on the shows and artists/performers.
      I created this map of concerts
      and shows using the Javascript API provided by
      <a href="http://here.com" target="_blank">HERE Technologies</a>,
      as well as the Javascript API provided by
      <a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.
